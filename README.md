The Logo Folder Creator is a Python script designed to simplify the process of organizing logo design assets by creating a standardized folder structure for your logo projects.

## Features

- **User Input:** The script prompts the user to enter a folder name and a desired path for the project.

- **Customizable:** Users can specify their desired project name and path, making it adaptable to various projects and storage locations.
- **Existing Folder Handling:** The script checks for the existence of folders and sub folders and updates them if the project already exists, ensuring data integrity.
